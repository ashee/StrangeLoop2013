## What's This?

This folder collects slides from the [Strange Loop](http://thestrangeloop.com) 2013 [sessions](http://thestrangeloop.com/sessions).

If you try to download slides and see a "Blob too big" error, then the file is too large for GitHub to serve through it's web API. In that case, you should clone the repo:

```git clone https://github.com/strangeloop/StrangeLoop2013.git```

## Tell Me More!

Go to the [Coverage](https://github.com/strangeloop/StrangeLoop2013/wiki/Coverage) wiki page for links to [pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/strangeloop2013/sets/), [videos](http://www.infoq.com/conferences/strangeloop2013/), blog reviews, and lots more.

Early draft videos are currently available only to attendees. Final videos will be released on [InfoQ](http://infoq.com) on a rolling basis for about 6 months following the conference.
